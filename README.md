To do: 

- Set background and create cube ✅
- figure out how to make each section of the cube rotate up, down, left and right (have to split the cube into sections one way or another)

- code main cube movements per section

- add actions 
    3- if you click and drag left, right, up or down the cube section rotates

    4. add button "shuffle" and "solve"✅
    5. display result 

- figure out how to solve the cube in less than 20 moves





transform 3d 
y = 0:
 x = 0; x= 1; x = 2 (transform (x*-200)+200) (x*-200)+200)
y = 1 
(transform (y*-100)+200) (x*-200)+200)
